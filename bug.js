This bug occurs when using the `useState` hook in React with an object as the initial state.  If you mutate the state directly, React won't detect the change and the component won't re-render.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, setState] = useState({ count: 0 });

  const increment = () => {
    state.count++; // Mutating the state directly
    setState(state); // React doesn't see the change because the object reference is the same
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
export default MyComponent;
```
